# Project : Database Design and Implementation
## Scenario  
In this scenario, you have recently been hired as a Data Engineer by a New York based coffee shop chain that is looking to expand nationally by opening a number of franchise locations. As part of their expansion process, they want to streamline operations and revamp their data infrastructure.

Your job is to design their relational database systems for improved operational efficiencies and to make it easier for their executives to make data driven decisions.

Currently their data resides in several different systems: accounting software, suppliersâ€™ databases, point of sales (POS) systems, and even spreadsheets. You will review the data in all of these systems and design a central database to house all of the data. You will then create the database objects and load them with source data. Finally, you will create subsets of data that your business partners require, export them, and then load them into staging databases that use different RDBMS.

## Software used in this project  
In this project, you will use **PostgreSQL Database**, **IBM Db2 Database**, and **MySQL**. These are all relational database management systems (RDBMS) designed to efficiently store, manipulate, and retrieve the data.
